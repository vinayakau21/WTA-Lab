// Final variables: When a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed once it has been initialized. This is useful for declaring constants or other values that should not be modified.
// Final methods: When a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden by a subclass. This is useful for methods that are part of a classâ€™s public API and should not be modified by subclasses.
// Final classes: When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This is useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified or extended.
